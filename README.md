Caching Slow Database Queries [![GoDoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/rocketlaunchr/remember-go?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/rocketlaunchr/remember-go) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/rocketlaunchr/remember-go)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/rocketlaunchr/remember-go)
===============

This package is used to cache the results of slow database queries in memory or Redis.
It can be used to cache any form of data. A Redis and in-memory storage driver is provided.

See [Article](https://medium.com/@rocketlaunchr.cloud/caching-slow-database-queries-1085d308a0c9) for further details including a tutorial.

The package is **production ready** and the API is stable. A variant of this package has been used in production for over 1.5 years.
Once the community creates more storage drivers, version 1.0.0 will be tagged. It is recommended your package manager locks to a commit id instead of the master branch directly.


## Installation

```
go get -u github.com/rocketlaunchr/remember-go
```


## Create a Key

### CreateKeyStruct

CreateKeyStruct can generate a JSON based key by providing a struct.

```go
type Key struct {
    Search string
    Page   int `json:"page"`
}

var key string = remember.CreateKeyStruct(Key{"golang", 2})
```


### CreateKey

CreateKey provides more flexibility to generate keys:

```go
key :=  remember.CreateKey(false, "-", "search-x-y", "search", "golang", 2)

// Key will be "search-golang-2"
```

## Initialize the Storage Driver

### In-Memory

```go
var ms = memory.NewMemoryStore(10 * time.Minute)
```

### Redis

The Redis storage driver relies on Gary Burd’s excellent [Redis client library](https://github.com/gomodule/redigo/).

```go
var rs = red.NewRedisStore(&redis.Pool{
	Dial: func() (redis.Conn, error) {
		return redis.Dial("tcp", "localhost:6379")
	},
})
```


## Create a SlowRetrieve Function

The package initially checks if data exists in the cache. If it doesn’t, then it elegantly fetches the data directly from the database by calling the `SlowRetrieve` function. It then saves the data into the cache so that next time it doesn’t have to refetch it from the database.

```go
type Result struct {
    Title string
}
slowQuery := func(ctx context.Context) (interface{}, error) {
    results := []Result{}
    stmt := `
        SELECT title
        FROM books
        WHERE title = ?
        ORDER BY title
        LIMIT ?, 20
    `
    rows, err := db.QueryContext(ctx, stmt, search, (page-1)*20)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    defer rows.Close()
    for rows.Next() {
        var title string
        if err := rows.Scan(&title); err != nil {
            return nil, err
        }
        results = append(results, Result{title})
    }
    return results, nil
}
```

## Usage

```go
import (
	"github.com/gomodule/redigo/redis"
	"github.com/rocketlaunchr/remember-go"
	"github.com/rocketlaunchr/remember-go/memory"
	red "github.com/rocketlaunchr/remember-go/redis"
)


key := remember.CreateKeyStruct(Key{"golang", 2})
exp := 10*time.Minute

results, found, err := remember.Cache(ctx, ms, key, exp, slowQuery, remember.Options{GobRegister: false})

return results.([]Result) // Type assert in order to use

```
